A Simple Flashcard Web App!
===========================

A simple way to keep track of words and definitions that I'm trying to memorize. 

User Stories

- I can visit the flash card app in my browser
- I can create a new card with a word, a definition, and a difficulty rating
- I can see a list of all my cards
- I can edit an existing card's word, definition, and difficulty
- I can go into "study" mode, where I see the word and the definition is hidden
- When I'm in study mode, I can reveal the definition

Other requirements
------------------

- Treat this like a real project
- Augment this Readme with the steps I need to install and run the code locally
- Study mode should not refresh the page (use jquery/Ajax for the NEXT button).
- Keep styling super simple - we are not expecting you to be a designer
- Ask questions!
- Make your git commits meaningful
- Use semantic HTML
- Use REST principals with the flash card resource
- This is for one user - don't worry about creating users, logging in, etc
- We don't expect you know how to do some of these things; that's the point!
